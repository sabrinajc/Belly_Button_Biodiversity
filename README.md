# Belly_Button_Biodiversity

In this project, we are helping Roza to build an interactive dashboard to explore the biodiversity of the belly button. We are identifying the top 10 bacterial species in each volunteer's belly buttons. We are using Javascript, Plotly and D3.js to create a horizontal bar chart, a bubble chart analyzing, and a gauge chart.
